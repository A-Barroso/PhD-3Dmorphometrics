# PhD-3Dmorphometrics
This is a repository for me to share drafted/complete R scripts for 3D Geometric Morphometric analyses.

These will be uploaded here for project management purposes as well as collaboration with colleagues.

I am currently working on several scripts that address different aspects of my particular research questions. My goal is to synthesize these into a single semi-automated script at a later point.


<b> The research: </b> My PhD research project investigates the phenomena of cultural regionalism in the Late Middle Palaeolithic landscape of North-west Europe, including the concept of identity and possible avenues for its socialÂ communication. I use a structured light scanner to generate models of Neanderthal handaxes for 3D Geometric Morphometric analyses, which I mainly compute through my own code in RStudio. I also carry out a modified form of lithic diacritical analysis to enhance and clarify the statistical data. The results are then interpreted through a heavily theoretical and interdisciplinary lens, allowing for a more holistic yet scientifically robust approach to a question that (currently) has sparse evidence with which to address it.
